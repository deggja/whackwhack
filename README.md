# Whack Whack â€” Revolution!

> A simple Whack-a-Mole type game built as a Single Page Application with HTML/SCSS and Vue/JS.

## Structure

[App.vue](/src/App.vue) is the main file. This keeps track of state (instead of a store) and pulls in child components. Data flows to child components through props.

Styles are located separately in [assets/styles](/src/assets/styles). Each Vue component has its own `block`, following the BEM methodology.
